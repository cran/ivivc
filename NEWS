~ 05/19/2014 (v0.2.0)
   - switched nls() to nlsLM() from package minpack.lm from this
     release; the default method 'LM' (the Levenberg-Marquardt 
     algorithm) is used like PKfit;
   - fixed some notations in the plot, such as R-sq notation in the plots;
   - updated DESCRIPTION - 'Description' by adding "Level A Correlation";
   - updated dataset in /extdata;
   
~ 10/25/2013 (v0.1.9)
   - fixed fitting algorithm with removing check();
   - fixed extdata with "dose once" for each MR dosage forms;
   - updated dataset in /extdata;
   - fixed output file names for test (demo) runs;

   - abandoned rgenoud from nonlinear fit;
   - moved sciplot, png, grid, rgenoud to Imports from Depends;
   - fixed some typos with spelling check;
   - fixed subj # check for inconsistent subj # between subj with PK
     parameters and subj in the in-vivo dataset;
   - provide a very brief user's guide (.pdf);
   - put all plots as one .pdf file; add two more libraries: 'png' and
     'grid';
